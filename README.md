# Paweł Broniarczyk | Portfolio

Hi! My name is Paweł Broniarczyk, I'm a frontend developer and welcome to my simple portfolio site (it's almost like "Hello World" - everyone need one, right?).

Created via CRA because project configuration is one of those tedious things I don't like. I know it could be an overkill to use CRA for something so small but latest version of this site was build in jQuery wrapped by Gulp so it's better that way. The old code will by placed in ma legacy folder far away from everyone's sight.
